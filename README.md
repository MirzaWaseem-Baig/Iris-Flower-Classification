# Iris-Flower-Classification
This repository contains the implementation of the Iris Flower Classification project, a classic example in machine learning and data science. The goal of this project is to classify iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) based on the length and width of their sepals and petals.
