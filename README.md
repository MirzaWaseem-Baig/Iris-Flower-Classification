## Iris Flower Classification

This repository contains the implementation of the Iris Flower Classification project, a classic example in machine learning and data science. The goal of this project is to classify iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) based on the length and width of their sepals and petals.

### Project Overview

The Iris Flower Classification project leverages the famous Iris dataset introduced by Ronald A. Fisher. The dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers, with each sample containing four features:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

### Objectives

1. **Data Exploration and Visualization**: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's structure and identify patterns or anomalies.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data to prepare it for model training.
3. **Model Selection and Training**: Train various classification models to predict the species of iris flowers based on the given features.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics and select the best-performing model.
5. **Model Deployment**: Provide a framework for deploying the model for real-time predictions.

### Features

- **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Gain insights from the dataset using visualizations.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implement various classification algorithms including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Trees.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy.

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MirzaWaseem-Baig/Iris-Flower-Classification.git
   cd iris-flower-classification
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Iris_Flower_Classifications.ipynb
   ```

### Dataset

The Iris dataset can be found (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris). It is also included in popular libraries like scikit-learn.

### Results

The project showcases the performance of different classification models and includes visualizations to compare their effectiveness.
